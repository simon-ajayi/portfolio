      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img class="resize" src="css/img/IMG_0372.jpg" alt="picture of Simon">
        <p>My name is Simon. I grew up in Happy Valley, Or. I went to <strong>Happy Valley High School</strong>, as you can expect. I did go to college for accounting but I realized that it wasn't the right fit for me. I was working at a company called Royal Bearing while I was going to college and decided to work full time. I worked from the summer of 2007 to December of 2015. I started out working in the warehouse doing many things inculding cleaning bearings, picking parts for orders, stocking inventory, packaging orders to go out and doing quality contorl for those orders. After a while, I became a sales person and did that for a few years. I <em>really</em> wasn't feeling like I was living up to my full potential there and wanted to have a career not just another job. I left that job in 2015 and am currently working as a Mail Carrier for the Postal Service. I was still looking for something else that was more interesting and challanging when my brother suggested I look into coding.</p>
